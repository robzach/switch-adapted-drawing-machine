Working with faculty and students at The Watson Institute[https://www.thewatsoninstitute.org/locations/sewickley-pa/], a school that serves children with disabilities, we have developed a prototype drawing machine for students to use in art class and other creative contexts. The device is to be presented as a demo at [the International Symposium of Academic Makerspaces 2025](https://isam2025.hemi-makers.org/) in functional prototype form, with the ability to manipulate a user-supplied drawing implement (marker, pen, pencil, etc.) to draw a user-selected line drawing, at a user-selected scale, in a user-selected location on a sheet of paper. All user inputs are switch-adapted for accessibility. 

The machineâ€™s hardware is simple to fabricate and assemble using facilities present at many makerspaces; the current design incorporates 3D printed major structural components, as well as common low-cost electronics and motors to drive motion. The firmware runs on an Arduino Mega and is designed for easy modification, including adding new line drawings that are described point-by-point. The hardware, electronics, and firmware are open-sourced under a nonrestrictive [CC-BY-4.0 license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) so as to allow others to build on this work, for adaptation to their own contexts or improvements to our design and implementation.
